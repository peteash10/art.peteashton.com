Spectral Songs of the Slitscanned Selfies builds on [Flatland Selfies](https://art.peteashton.com/flatland-selfies/) by adding the dimension of sound. I had been playing with Alexander Zolotov's [Virtual ANS](http://warmplace.ru/soft/ans/), based on a mid-20th century Russian instrument, which treats 2D images as spectrograms, reading them from left to right and turning them into sound. Unlike most instruments it breaks down into a potentially infinite number of microtones creating an eerie spacey sound that was used in a number of Soviet sci-fi movies. 

In short, the ANS allows you to see what photos sounded like. I later used this technique in the lecture/performance [Live Sonification of Photography](https://art.peteashton.com/live-sonification-photography/).
