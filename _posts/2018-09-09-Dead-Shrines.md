[Dead Shrines](https://www.hipkissandgraney.com/the-dead-shrines-project) is an ongoing project by artist duo [Hipkiss and Graney](https://www.hipkissandgraney.com/), constructing large wooden sculptures in public spaces as a focus for community-focussed events. 

I was heavily involved in designing the Dead Shrine for Stirchley Park and ran two events in the subsequent programme, a [camera obscura making workshop](https://www.instagram.com/p/Byfe0_sl0-y/) and a talk on the history of the camera obscura and why it might be relevant today.

I give my talk on the history and contemporary relevance of the camera obscura in Stirchley Park as part of a series of symposiums.
