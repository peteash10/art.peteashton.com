# The Black Box

The Black Box is a 3 metre tall monoliths that spits out a piece of paper on average once a minute. On this paper are "instructions" in text and visual form, generated by a machine learning algorithm. The visitor is invited to take a piece of paper that resonates with them and use it in whatever way they see fit. 

The Black Box references [black box systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box) "which can be viewed in terms of their inputs and outputs without any knowledge of its internal workings."

Part of the [Instructions for Humans](http://instructionsforhumans.com) exhibition running at Birmingham Open Media, September - December 2017.
