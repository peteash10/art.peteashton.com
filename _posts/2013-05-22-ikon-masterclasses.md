During 2013-15 I did a number of workshops for the [Ikon gallery](https://www.ikon-gallery.org)'s education department, using photography to drive engagement with the lead art exhibition at that time. These were devised with then-head of education Simon Taylor and mostly fell under their Masterclass strand. 

The format was fairly simple. After an introduction from myself to around 10 participants, a curator or member of Ikon's team would lead the group around the gallery, talking about the work with a particular emphasis on the artist's process. How did they approach making their work and how did their methodology help them achieve their aims? That sort of thing. 

Returning to the classroom we would then discuss how we could apply this way of thinking to our photography. In some cases, such as AK Dolven, we twisted our ideas of "good" photography, defocussing and breaking the rules to achieve new abstractions. In others, such as Hurvin Anderson's paintings, we absorbed his subject matter to focus our point of view of the world. 

Time moved on, staffing changed, and the Masterclasses dried up, but I have fond memories of them and would love to work again with arts organisations to use photography to get their audiences to creatively engage with their exhibits. Hit me up if you're interested and have a budget.
