During 2013 I become a bit obsessed with selfies, specifically how they were dismissed by "proper" photographers and adopted predominantly by young women. Those two things seemed connected. I collected hundreds of thousands from Instagram (their API was very liberal at the time and allowed bulk downloading) and set about making sense of them. 

The resulting video essay was included in a shorts screening at the Flatpack Film Festival 2014. The title has meaning:

- Typologies - from the classic work by Bernd and Hilla Becher.
- Hypernetworked - that which is on the internet.
- Vernacular - of the people. Vernacular photography is the only true photography.
- Self-Portrature - selfies, by any other name.
