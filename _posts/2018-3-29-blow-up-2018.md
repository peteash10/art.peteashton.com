A poster imagining a reboot of Michelangelo Antonioni classic 1966 thriller [Blow-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowup) as **Blow-up 2018** drawing paralells between the fashion photographer's indiference to model Veruschka and the corporate indifference of Google and Facebook to the personal data we present to them. 

In the remake, David Hemmings no longer plays a fictionalised David Bailey but is cast as a data centre, seen by many as the purest manifestation of data-churning internet giants. Veruschka retains her orignal role as raw material, to be processed, manipulated, her image productised and her body ultimately discarded. 

The scene in question has been crudely maniupulated by myself to accompany the poster in the following video.

The poster was part of the [Black Hole Club 2018 group show](http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/programme/blackholeclub2018/) at Vivid Projects, 30th March 2018.
