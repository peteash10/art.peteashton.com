Show and Tell was a short-lived monthly meetup for artists run at [Artefact](http://artefactstirchley.co.uk) in Stirchley, south Birmingham, to talk with peers about any problems they were having with their work. Groups ran from 2 to 10 people and it turns out everyone has the same problems! 

I put it on hold while Instructions for Humans was running and then developed it into the on-going Stirchley Salon format.
