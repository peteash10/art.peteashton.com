**Instructions for Humans** is my next major piece of work which will be centred around a solo exhibition at [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk) in November 2017. 

Subject to funding applications, the work will be developed from May to September 2017 and be available for touring from 2018 onwards. 

More details will be available here very soon.
