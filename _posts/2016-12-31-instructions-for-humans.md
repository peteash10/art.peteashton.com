**Instructions for Humans** is my next major piece of work which will be centred around a solo exhibition at [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk) in November 2017. 

Subject to funding applications, the work will be developed from May to September 2017 and be available for touring from 2018 onwards. 

A blog, [instructionsforhumans.tumblr.com](https://instructionsforhumans.tumblr.com), is collecting examples of humans performing for the benefit of machines. Further examples are welcome. 

More details will be available here very soon.
