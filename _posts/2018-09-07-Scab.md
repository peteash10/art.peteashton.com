Scab is a 3D model build using [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) from frames taken from a video of a repeatedly scratched mosquito bite on my leg. 

It was produced for the [Black Hole Club's online exhibition](https://blackholeclub.hotglue.me) where members were invited to explore how their practices exists in an online space.
