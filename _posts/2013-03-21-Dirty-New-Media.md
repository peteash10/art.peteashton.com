In 2013 I was asked by my friend and Vivid Projects curator Antonio Roberts to photography an event he was running for the documentation. [Dirty New Media](http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/programme/revolution-02-dirty-new-media/) was a follow-up to [GLI.TC/H](http://gli.tc/h/) which he had brought to Birmingham in 2011. As I took my photos the following things went through my mind.

- I could do that.
- I would never do that.
- That's brilliant.
- I did something like that. 
- That's stupid, and I can explain why. 
- I want to do something like that. 

Basically I felt I was watching a peer group I should, or could, be part of. 

So, on 21st March 2013 I decided to actually become a proper artist, doing this sort of thing as professionally as possible. 

I happened to be sitting next to Karen Newman, now director of [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk), and asked her if she did mentoring for people who thought they might be artists. The rest is documented on this website.
