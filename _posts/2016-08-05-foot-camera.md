Foot Camera was an experiment in extending the body camera to other areas. The long term plan was to attach cameras to many articulation points on my body and play them back simultaneously in a gallery, but that never came to pass. 

The walk was Laura Oldfield Ford's group walk for her residency at Grand Union, looking at the [Battle of Saltly Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saltley_Gate).
