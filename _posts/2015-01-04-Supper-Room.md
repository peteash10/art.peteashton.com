An exercise in image degredation, riffing off Alvin Lucier's [I Am Sitting In A Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room). The Last Supper is turned into a globe and rotated 10,000 times in ImageMagick. Each rotation saves a new JPEG which compresses the image degrading it slightly. When does it stop being the Last Supper? Is the question I was asking.

I also produced a cropped version so you can see the degradation close up.
