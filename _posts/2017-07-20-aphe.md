I was one of the artists speaking at this conference in Norwich on 20th July 2017. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a record of it on the web any more so you'll have to take my word for it. 

If some evidence does emerge again, I'll post it here. 

Note to self - expect conference websites to last no longer than two years after which the domain and hosting will expire. Archive that stuff.
