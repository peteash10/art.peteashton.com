The [Coventry Artspace](https://coventry-artspace.co.uk) has a unit in the soon-to-be-demolished City Arcadia shopping centre which members of [Black Hole Club](http://www.blackholeclub.com) were invited to use for three days to mess around with audio/visual technology and see where it took them. 

I decided to use this opportunity to do an audit of all the random cameras, sensors and computers I'd gathered over my [BOM Fellowship](http://art.peteashton.com/bom-fellowship/) and related projects like Speculative Cameras, to see if I was still interested in any of it. 

Rather embarrasingly at the time it turned out I wasn't. Whatever it was I wanted to do with my art, it probably wasn't going to involve these boxes of tech. Which, on reflection, meant I had a clean slate to work with. 

I did produce one piece of work, an homage to Adam Magyar's [Stainless](https://vimeo.com/83663312) which I shot with my phone on the train in to Coventry and back to Birmingham. I put this in the window of the unit for the duration of the residency.
