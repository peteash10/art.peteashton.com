[Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) is an 1884 novel by Edwin A. Abbott which attempts to explain the concept of a fourth dimension by describing our three-dimensional experience from the point of a view of a two dimensional creature. A circle's experience of a sphere is analogous to our experience of a 4D [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube), goes the thinking. 

I've always liked the Flatland model since first coming across it in [Rudy Rucker's *The Fourth Dimension*](http://www.rudyrucker.com/thefourthdimension/) and while playing around with slicing and dicing pictures using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) I wondered how a resident of Flatland might experience a photograph. 

The images I used came from a massive stash of selfies I'd downloaded from Instagram (when Instagram had a very lax API which allowed such things).

The following videos are three different attempts to show this.
