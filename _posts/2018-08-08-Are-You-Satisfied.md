In August 2017, I, along with Fiona and a few BOM friends, were extras in [Rachel Maclean[(http://www.rachelmaclean.com)'s new film Are You Satisfied, made as part of her Channel 4 sponsored residency at Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre which was broadcast a year later. 

[I wrote about the experience here.](http://blog.peteashton.com/1533688860)

At time of writing [the C4 programme](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-shopping-centre-artist-in-residence) is still on their iPlayer-clone.
