In 2016 I was "invited" to work with the [Käpt'n Iglo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Birdseye) brand by an [agency's database](https://www.zooppa.com) which had been mislead as to the substance of my work. I decided to play along as if it were a serious commission and produced a piece of work reminiscent of existing work, specifically [Spinning in a Room](https://art.peteashton.com/spinning-room/) and [Supper Room](https://art.peteashton.com/supper-room/).

I submitted the Käpt'n Iglo logo rotating into digital mush to their platform and heard nothing back. I then gave seven other corporate sigils the same treatment.
