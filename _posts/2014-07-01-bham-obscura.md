[Birmingham Obscura](http://bhamobscura.com), or Birmingham Camera Obscura, was started by [Jenny Duffin](http://www.jennyduffin.com/) and myself in 2014 when we decided to build a camera obscura and take it around for people to experience. It has manifested in a number of projects, mainly based around the [professional-grade camera](https://art.peteashton.com/bhamobscura-2/) we crowdfunded to build. 

The project has formally been on hiatus since 2017 as work and other projects took up our time, but I continued to do occasional obscura work and am keen to bring it back in some form. If you are interested in joining the Birmingham Obscura project, please get in touch! 

The [bhamobscura.com](http://bhamobscura.com) website archives our activities from 2014-17 and will at some point be revised. There are also [many photos on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bhamobscura/sets/).
