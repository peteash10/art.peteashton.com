As part of the never ending attempt to make sense of the photographs taken during the [Cross City Walks](http://xcw.org.uk), Andy Howlett and I proposed [an interative movie for 2015's Flatpack Film Festival](http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/cross-city-walks/) alongside the [Video Strolls](https://videostrolls.com/2015/03/01/video-strolls-at-flatpack-film-festival/) programme of walking-related films. The installation was realised on a zero budget in the derelict attic of the [Centrala](http://centrala-space.org.uk) cafe in a coverted Digbeth industrial space.

The film was a simple slideslow of the photos taken by a chest-mounted GoPro camera. By walking on a treadmill people could control the speed of the film as they walked across an ersatz Birmingham projected in front on them on a giant five by three metre screen.

The installation was accompanied by [an essay by Andy](http://xcw.org.uk/flatpack-festival-installation-2015/forward/) and I later wrote up some [reflections on the experience](http://xcw.org.uk/towards-a-theory-of-cross-city-walks/). 

We would be very interested in doing something similar with an actual budget involving money and equipment that works properly.
