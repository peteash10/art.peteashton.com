In 2017 I applied for and received an Engine micro-bursary from New Art West Midlands to visit the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria, in return for writing a report about it for those back home. 

[The report can be read here.](http://newartwestmidlands.co.uk/editorial/pete-ashton-on-ars-electronica-linz/)

Due to my [Linz residency in 2016](http://art.peteashton.com/goodbye-wittgenstein/) I was able to stay with the [qujOch√ñ](http://qujochoe.org/) artist collective who invited me to be part of the performance of their game [Myth of Theuth](https://qujochoe.org/myth-of-theuth-ars-electronica-festival-2017/), which got me accreditation as an Artist, which was nice.
