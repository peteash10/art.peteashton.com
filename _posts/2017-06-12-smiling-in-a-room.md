A photo of Alvin Lucier is uploaded to FaceApp's smile generator 300 times. Very quickly another face emerges. Is this the original smile?

A sequel, of sorts, to [Sitting Instagram](http://art.peteashton.com/sitting-in-stagram/), inspired as ever by [I Am Sitting In A Room](http://youtu.be/fAxHlLK3Oyk).
