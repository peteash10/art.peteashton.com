A photo of Alvin Lucier is uploaded to FaceApp's smile generator 300 times. Very quickly another face emerges. Is this the original smile?

A sequel, of sorts, to [Sitting Instagram](http://art.peteashton.com/sitting-in-stagram/), inspired as ever by [I Am Sitting In A Room](http://youtu.be/fAxHlLK3Oyk) where Lucier recorded a recording of his voice in a room over and over until all that was left was the resonance, the echoes, of the room, revealing it's structure through sound alone.
