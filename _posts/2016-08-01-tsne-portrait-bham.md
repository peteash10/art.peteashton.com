**A Portrait of Birmingham** is a record of a walk across the city in a straight line, from one Outer Circle bus stop to its opposite number, photographed at five second intervals from a chest mounted camera. The photographs have been sliced into 12 squares and arranged by a [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) sorting algorithm and a neural network trained to recognise the contents of images, resulting in a taxonomy for a core sample of the city.

The work uses artificial intelligence algorithms to interrogate the visual identity of a modern post-industrial suburban city and builds on the psychographical work Cross City Walks developed by the artist in collaboration with Andy Howlett (see [xcw.org.uk](http://xcw.org.uk)). As a whole it challenges the traditional notion of a city landscape and employs the otherwise mundane features to collectively represent the city from street level. The algorithmic sorting creates pockets of comparison, echoing the Typologies of [Bernd and Hilla Becher](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/bernd-becher-and-hilla-becher-718), revealing the subtle differences across similar features, while glitches and edge-cases create amusing juxtapositions.
