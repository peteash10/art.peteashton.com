# Instructions for Humans - A Cargo Cult for Artificial Intelligence

Three months of new work by [Pete Ashton](http://art.peteashton.com/) exploring human interactions with complex systems, centred around and lending it's name to a wider Instructions for Humans exhibition exploring Internet art in an age of mass surveillance at [BOM (Birmingham Open Media)](http://bom.org.uk) from 13 September to 16 December 2017. 

The phenomena of [cargo cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) was observed on South Pacific islands after WWII as islanders used ritual to try and make sense of the advanced military technology that had suddenly entered their lives. Instructions for Humans asks: what might a cargo cult for artificial intelligence look like? 

The work uses recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to explore the systems that guide society and our relationship to them. 

**Work produced in the gallery is being documented and archived on the website [instructionsforhumans.com](http://instructionsforhumans.com). I would direct your attention there. This page will be properly updated when the exhibition is over.**
