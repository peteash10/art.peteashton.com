A wooden triangle structure with three H shapes on each corner mimicking the antenna of a cell tower mast. 

Inspired by [a photo from Puerto Rico post-hurricane](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/09/disconnected-by-disasterphotos-from-a-battered-puerto-rico/540975/#img08) where people are gathered around a cell tower waiting for the signal to come back on. Traditionally folk would gather at the church or town hall for information or solace, but this is now provided by the digital network which is physically manifested by the tower. 

This connected with my interest in the post-WWII [cargo cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) of the South Pacific and the [gestures and rituals](http://curiousrituals.nearfuturelaboratory.com) that have emerged during the Internet age. 

Part of the [Instructions for Humans](http://instructionsforhumans.com/) exhibition, Sept-Dec 2017.
