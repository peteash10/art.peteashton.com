I went to the [Resonate](http://resonate.io/) art/tech conference in Belgrade in 2017 and signed up for [Kate Sicchio](http://blog.sicchio.com)'s Hacking Choreography workshop which, broadly, explored using coding, and coding models of thinking, to work with dance and movement. In the limited time available we produced a t-SNE piece using a piece of dance Kate performed in the space but also covered lots of interesting ideas around scoring dance and the overlap of instruction for movement and coding computers.

A lot of the things I learned in this workshop fed into [Instructions for Humans](https://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/), specifically the piece [Data Cult](https://art.peteashton.com/data-cult/) with Emily Warner and Aleks Wojtulewicz, via the [Echo Edit](https://art.peteashton.com/echo_edit/) experimental piece. 

## t-SNE Kate

t-SNE is sorting algorithm that can be coupled with image classification to map images according to their similarity. We all created a t-SNE cloud of Kate's movements. Here are mine. (Click for bigger.)

## Animations

The t-SNE was made with PNG files with transparent backgrounds, which when put into an animation (such as a GIF) will stack on top of each other, creating time-trails. This wasn't part of the workshop - just a fun thing I did in the evening.
