The [Experimental Capture workshop](https://www.bom.org.uk/event/artandtech-pete-ashton/) was part of [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk) (BOM)'s Art & Tech Social strand where artists and technologists shared some learning to the public over curry and drinks. 

BOM had supported by trip to [Golan Levin's Experimental Capture workshop](http://art.peteashton.com/levin-exp-cap/) earlier in the year as part of my [Fellowship](http://art.peteashton.com/bom-fellowship/) on the understanding that I would share what I'd learned with the local community, so this was also the formal part of that. 

Subjects covered included: 

- **Slo-mo and time-lapse**. Seeing how we can control time to illuminate change.
- **Photogrammetry.** Extracting 3D models of objects from simple video.
- **Alternative wavelengths.** Exploring how recording infra-red, ultraviolet, heat and radio waves can be used in artistic documentation.
- **Depth sensors.** Using the gaming tool Kinect to record distance alongside colour.
- **After Hockney.** Using photo-merge and montage to represent many moments in one image.
