I had a short period as a [chiptune DJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune) at Kings Heath's fashionable Hare and Hounds pub and was asked to show / present something at 7inch Cinema's 8bit night on June 28th 2010. I ran this video and talked over it, attempting to explain what was going on.

7inch Cinema was the precursor to, and eventually folded into, the [Flatpack Film Festival](http://flatpackfestival.org.uk). 

(I found the chiptune scene interesting because they made complex work with a very limited palette. Ironically I have zero interest in computer games. For this reason I stopped DJing at computer games events and 8bit Pete was retired.)
