While we waited for the new [Birmingham Camera Obscura](http://art.peteashton.com/bhamobscura-2/) to be built, Jenny Duffin and I put together a small obscura installation for the 2015 [Flatpack Film Festival](https://flatpackfestival.org.uk). We constructed some small obscuras to hang in the window of a city centre cafe which would show little live movies of the world outside, albeit it upside down.
