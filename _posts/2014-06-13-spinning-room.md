Riffing off Alvin Lucier's classic [I Am Sitting In A Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room), I took a selfie, turned it into a disc and repeatedly asked ImageMagick to rotate it by 1 degree 10,000 times. Each rotation meant re-saving the file as a JPEG, a lossy format which throws away a small amount of data. Usually this is unnoticeable but by repeating the process 10,000 times the image quickly degrades. The soundtrack is the strip of pixels at 6 o'clock for each frame fed through the ANS synth.

This work builds on [Spectral Selfies](https://art.peteashton.com/spectral-slitscanned-selfies/) and the degradation was an accidental discovery while developing [Live Sonification of Photography](https://art.peteashton.com/live-sonification-photography/)
