A project run alongside Jon Bounds' celebration of the Number 11 Bus in Birmingham which travels around the Outer Circle, taking in the full variety of suburbs that make up the city. I decided to photograph every other bus stop with my TTV camera. 

I really need to re-do this properly at some point.
