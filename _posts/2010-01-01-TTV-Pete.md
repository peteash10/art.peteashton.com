TTV Pete was my first attempt at an "artistic practice", starting in August 2006 when I came across the technique on Flickr of photographying Through The Viewfinder of another, often vintage, camera. A community emerged around this technique, formalising jargon and encouraging innovation. By the time I abandoned it I had produced [over 2,000 images](https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/albums/72157594253244021) and spent two years selling prints at art markets and in shops.  

This period of experimental photography seeded many ideas which influenced my later art practice, specifically the speculative cameras / experimental capture research and work using camera obscuras.
