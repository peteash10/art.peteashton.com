An A0 poster listing URLs for all the trackers found on a story on the [Birmingham Mail website](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk) in September 2017, sending data about readers to 3rd party companies who aggregate them to build profiles for advertising and other nefarious purposes. The Mail's owners, Trinity Mirror, sell the right to place these trackers alongside visible advertising. They can be identified and blocked using a browser plugin like [Ghostery](http://ghostery.com).
