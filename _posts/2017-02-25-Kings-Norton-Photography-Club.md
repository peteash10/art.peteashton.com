A talk given for the [Kings Norton Photography Society](http://kingsnortonphotographicsociety.com) in south Birmingham on 25th January 2017.

They asked me to talk about photographing cities and I took the opportunity to introduce a relatively traditional but open-minded group of photographes to some new developments in computational photography. It was a lot of fun and helped me nail a new concepts I'd been working on. 

Many works shown can be found in Nicholas Felton's book [Photoviz](http://photoviz.tumblr.com).
