The artist is based in the gallery from September to December 2017 for the [Instructions for Humans](http://instructionsforhumans.com/) exhibition. Visitors are invited to talk to the artist about the exhibition. These conversations with the artist are recorded because the artist has a terrible memory and would like to know what was talked about. The recordings are summarised by the transcriber, [Karen Cameron](https://twitter.com/KCanard). The transcriber was not in the gallery and only has the audio from one microphone to go on. Errors and assumptions are made. These are not corrected. 

The artist presents the trascripts on the walls of the gallery and has conversations with visitors about them. The transcriber continues to summarise conversations, some of which are now about her transcripts. This produces [interesting feedback loops](https://amwritingthings.tumblr.com/post/166671665230/systems-in-the-text). 

[The transcripts are archived online](http://instructionsforhumans.com/transcripts/).
