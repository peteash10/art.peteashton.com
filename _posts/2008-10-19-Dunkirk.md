[Dunkirk](https://vimeo.com/2008572) was a short film made in 48 hours by Rachael Marchant, Danny Smith and myself in 2008 for a competition called [Film Dash](http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/09/08/film-dash-birminghams-48-hour-film-challenge/). We were given the title "Dunkirk" and a quote which had to be included somewhere in the film. 

The main character is a Thingamagoop, an optical synthesiser I'd recently acquired, and his point of view was filmed through a Through the Viewfinder contraption. The "voice" is played on the Thingamagoop. 

We won the competition and our film was screened at the Electric Cinema.
