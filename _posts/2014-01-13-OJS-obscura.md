A week after [turning the Rotunda into a camera](http://art.peteashton.com/rotunda-obscura/), Jenny's contacts book got us the use of a third-floor theatre overlooking Birmingham Cathedral, so we decided to turn that into a camera too. 

Being a theatre, the room was already blacked out so most of the work was spent on the "screen". The resulting image was very pleasing.
