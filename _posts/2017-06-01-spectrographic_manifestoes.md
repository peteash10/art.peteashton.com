# Spectrographic Manifestoes


Interactive sonification installation at [Transmission](http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/programme/transmission/), a group show at Vivid Projects, Birmingham, exploring curious audio transmission methods. 2 â€“ 3 June 2017

Manifesto launch speeches by Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn were transformed into spectrographs which could be ready by passing a photographic sonification application over them.

Primary tools are the excellent [PhonoPaper](http://warmplace.ru/soft/phonopaper) app and [ANS Synth emulator](http://warmplace.ru/soft/ans/) from Alexander Zolotov.
