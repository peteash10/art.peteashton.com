t-SNE, or [t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding), is is a machine learning algorithm for visualization where similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points. In other words, it finds similar looking things and clusters them together. 

t-SNE was an entry-level demo during the Machine Learning Arts gold-rush because it could be relatively easily run on a laptop and produced a nice visual result. It also served to answer the question "what can we do with all these bloody images we're generating?" We can stick them in a t-SNE grid. 

My main piece of t-SNE work from this period is [A Portrait of Birmingham](https://art.peteashton.com/portrait-bham) but there were of course many experiments which I keep in [a Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/albums/72157673603497335), many of which rework image collections from other works of mine.
