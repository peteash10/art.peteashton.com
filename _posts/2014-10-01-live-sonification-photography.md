**Live Sonification of Photography** was a performance / lecture at sound-art salon [If Wet](http://www.ifwet.org.uk/) in of a new system for turning photographs into sound as a performance piece incorporating portrature, image manipulation and the ANS synth.

This was the culmination of a year or so’s work exploring slit-scan photography, performance photography, sonification of images and many other disparate things.

The presentation is about 25 minutes long with 10 minutes of intro, 10 minutes of demo and 5 minutes of Q&A. Thanks to Sam Underwood and David Morton for hosting.
