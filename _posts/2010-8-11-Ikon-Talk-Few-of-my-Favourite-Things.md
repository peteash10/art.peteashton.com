The Ikon gallery in Birmingham had a series of talks called "These Are a Few of my Favourite Things", a Desert Island Discs-style event where guests talk about eight works of art. For some reason I was asked to speak in the 2010 programme, presumaby because the Created in Birmingham blog had mad a bit of an impact on these scene, or maybe they just had a space they needed to fill. Whatever the reasoning I blunded in with my selection of stuff-I-like-that-might-be-art and spoke to a surprisingly full room.

My favourite things were:

1. The Internet
2. [kottke.org](http://kottke.org)
3. [Nan Goldin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nan_Goldin)
4. The bubbleglass of the [Duaflex](https://flic.kr/p/fuWN5M) viewfinder.
5. [Eddie Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Campbell)'s ALEC
6. [Raymond Pettibon](http://www.artnet.com/artists/raymond-pettibon/)'s 80s zines and posters.
7. The Kleptones' [Night At The Hip-Hopera](https://kleptones.com/pages/downloads_hiphopera.html) album.
8. [Mario Paint Composer covers](https://geekandsundry.com/our-favorite-song-classics-covered-by-mario-paint-composer/).

I was interviewed by Kate Self, then an education officer at Ikon, who later hired me to do the website for their [youth programme](https://www.ikon-gallery.org/event/ikon-youth-programme-2/), which led to a few photography masterclasses over the years. I'm still waiting for my solo show in the main gallery though...
