Whenever I come back to the UK through customs I always note the indignity of sorting human beings into groups. The way harried border staff impose arbitrary legislation on foreign nationals for no real benefit is embarrassing. The whole thing makes me wish for a world without borders. 

On 1st December 2016 I was traveling into the UK. A few months previous, Brexit had happened. While I was away Trump had won the election. 

[Fuck Your Flags](https://vimeo.com/193939679) was made that night. It uses crude pixel-sorting algorithms to turn the flags of the world into bands of colour. The programme picks a pixel at random, compares it to its neighbour and swaps it so that the brighter one is on the left. And so on, and so on. 

In some countries these icons are sacred. Fuck that.
