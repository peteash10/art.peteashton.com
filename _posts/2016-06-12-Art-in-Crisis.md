Art in Crisis was a project run by homelessness charity [Crisis](https://www.crisis.org.uk) and arts organisation [Birmingham Open Media (BOM)](http://bom.org.uk), the latter of which I was a Fellow with. Three BOM Fellows, including myself, worked with Crisis clients to document their experiences. The resulting works, made in collaboration with them, were presented in the BOM gallery for a month. 

I worked with John, Gareth and Alan, walking with cameras around Digbeth which they photographed from their perspective. We reviewed and discussed what to do with the photos and I produced the following three videos.

[A symposium on the project](http://kateself.com/art-crisis-festival-2016/) was arranged by Kate Self, taking place at Eastside Projects, where I spoke briefly about the work. The videos were also screened as part of the Open Air Cinema at the Art in Crisis Festival on 23rd July.
