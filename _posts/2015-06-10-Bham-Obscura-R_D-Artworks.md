Over the winter of 2015-16, the [Birmingham Obscura](http://bhamobscura.com/) project, being Jenny Duffin and myself, recruited four other artists via open call to propose new artworks to be made with our recently built camera obscura. We took their proposals and successful received an R&D grant from the Arts Council to produce them, with the long-term intention of discovering how the camera obscura could be used by artists in the 21st century.
