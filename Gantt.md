*The Art Gantt* is a spreadsheet used to manage this website which also generates a graphical visualisation of my art practice and related activities since 2010.

Time runs along the top, activities down the side. Some projects are ongoing, hence the long line. Others only last a day or so. Everything is rounded up to the nearest month. 

I like this method of showing activity over time and hope to develop it further.
