My name is [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com).

I'm a multidisciplinary artist working in Birmingham, a city in the North West of Europe. My work uses media technologies to explore how we perceive and understand the world around us. Completely self-taught, I use art to look at traditionally academic subjects in new ways, seeing it as a form of applied philosophical enquiry. 

After a prolonged confused existence I realised I was an artist in my 40s and have centred my practice on cameras as post-photographic data-capture devices. Like [most data-artists](https://twitter.com/holyurl/status/894326191724867584) I am concerned with identity, privacy and corporate surveillance under late-capitalism and attempt to make work about this that doesn't simply involve screaming helplessly into the void. 

Throughout 2017 I will be producing [Instructions For Humans](http://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/), a new body of work culminating exhibiting from September.

I occasionally [blog](http://blog.peteashton.com).
