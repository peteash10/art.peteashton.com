My name is [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com).

I'm a multidisciplinary multimedia artist creating transformative site-specific work, online and offline. My work uses media technologies to explore how we perceive and understand the world around us, from camera obscura lens art to algorithmic image manipulation. I live and work in Birmingham in the North West of Europe with my [wife](http://fionacullinan.com) and a pack of [rabbits](http://bunminster.uk).

The previous paragraph can serve as an artist biography should you need one from me. 

An advocate of peer and self-learning, I use art to look at traditionally academic subjects in new ways, seeing it as a form of applied philosophical enquiry. 

I realised I was an artist in my late 30s and have centred my practice on cameras as post-photographic data-capture devices. Like [most data-artists](https://twitter.com/holyurl/status/894326191724867584) I am concerned with identity, privacy and corporate surveillance under late-capitalism and attempt to make work about this that doesn't simply involve screaming helplessly into the void.
