My name is [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com).

I'm an artist based in Birmingham in the North West of Europe. My work centres on cameras as post-photographic data-capture devices with an interest in realising their output through mechanical/human gesture.

Throughout 2017 I will be producing [Instructions For Humans](http://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/), a new body of work culminating in a solo show in November.

I occasionally [blog](http://blog.peteashton.com). 

I've been a practicing artist since 2013 after four decades of slowly coming to the conclusion I might be an artist.
