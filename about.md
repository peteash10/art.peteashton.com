My name is [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com).

I'm a multidisciplinary artist working in Birmingham in the North West of Europe. My work uses media technologies to explore how we perceive and understand the world around us. An advocate of peer and self-learning, I use art to look at traditionally academic subjects in new ways, seeing it as a form of applied philosophical enquiry. 

I realised I was an artist in my early 40s and have centred my practice on cameras as post-photographic data-capture devices. Like [most data-artists](https://twitter.com/holyurl/status/894326191724867584) I am concerned with identity, privacy and corporate surveillance under late-capitalism and attempt to make work about this that doesn't simply involve screaming helplessly into the void. 

I occasionally [blog](http://blog.peteashton.com). 

If I'm working with you on a project and you need a photo, please feel free to use any on this page.
