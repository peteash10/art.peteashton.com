[Photo School](http://photo-school.co.uk) was started in 2012 by [Matt Murtagh](https://twitter.com/mattmurtagh) and myself when we noticed that many of our non-photographer friends were buying fully-fuctional DSLR cameras as the prices had recently dropped to the same as a decent compact. They didn't know how to use them, but they weren't interested in doing a long course run by a college to become a "professional" - they just wanted to take better pictures. 

We trailed a number of classes using Matt's academic photographic knowledge and my experience in social media training, settling on a Beginners model which, with yearly iterations, still runs to this day. After a couple of years Matt ceased freelancing and, with his blessing, I took on Photo School as my own project, developing it to comprise a quarter of my freelance income and folding it into my art practice. 

Photo School is centred around [Beginners Photography](http://photo-school.co.uk/beginners-photography/), enabling me to refine my knowledge of camera technology by repeatedly explaining it in new ways to different people. I also run regular [Photo Walks](http://photo-school.co.uk/walks/) around Birmingham which I see as equal parts photography class, community activity, guided tour and, of course, art. The walks lead to my first Arts Council funded activity, Photographic Exploration of Space, where I explored ideas arond group photography as a collaborative artwork. 

Photo School continues to be an important part of my work and art practice and runs from the website [photo-school.co.uk](photo-school.co.uk)
