Dead Space was a series of exhibitions organised by Clare Farrel (now trading as WERK) building on the [mural paintings by Lucy McLauchlan](http://lucy.beat13.co.uk/outside/udhutxk86mifo5fy4eeglk0lrb0uw1) on the now-demolished Birmingham Central Library.  Clare invited me to make some work using the TTV Photography technique and despite a very limited budget (Â£100) I decided to build a giant sculpture using old CRT monitors and cardboard tubes to showcase video work I'd been making recently.

I obviously didn't know what I was doing and afterwards wasn't sure what had happened or whether it was any good, but in hindsight I'm pleased with it as a first stab at being a "proper" exhibiting artist, rather than someone who sells prints at markets.
