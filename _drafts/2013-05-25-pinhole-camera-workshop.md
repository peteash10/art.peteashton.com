This was a pinhole photography workshop run with [Jenny Duffin](http://www.jennyduffin.com) for the Birmingham Architecture Festival. It was notable because we then went on to co-run the [Birmingham Camera Obscura](http://bhamobscura.com) project together which changed everything.

Oddly enough, while we've done many many things we've never run a pinhole workshop again.
